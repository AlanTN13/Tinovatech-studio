# NextJS Studio

This is a NextJS starter project with sample content management features. It no longer relies on Firebase.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY` to your Google Generative AI key which is required by the AI features.
